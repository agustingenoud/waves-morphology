# Generating Sound and Organizing Time Roadtrip

This repository was created to track the patching practices learned through the reading of **"Generating Sound and Organizing Time"** by Graham Wakefield & Gregory Taylor. The book was published by Cycling '74 (October 14, 2022).

### Repo structure

The *book-examples* directory represents almost all the patches showed as examples in the book. The *modules* directory holds broad experiments from the lessons learned, hopefully will be very populated in the near future.
