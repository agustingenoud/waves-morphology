# Generating Sound and Organizing Time Roadtrip

This repository was created to trackthe patching practices learnes through the reading of **"Generating Sound and Organizing Time"** by Graham Wakefield & Gregory Taylor.

The *book-examples* directory represents almost all the patches showed as examples in the book. The *modules* directory holds broad experiments from the lessons learned, hopefully will be very populated in the near future.
